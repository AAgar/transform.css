# Transform.css
A ton of <em>free, easy-to-use</em> css animations. Transform your website from <i>plain</i> to <b>awesome and cool</b>


<h1> Note, transform.css is currently in development, and the website is not comeplete yet </h1>

## How to use `transform.css`
Download the css file either from this page or from the [project's website](https://akshar13.github.io/transform.css)



To use these *awesome css animations*, you must first add the stylesheet to your file(s) within the head tags like so:
  ```html
  <head>
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="transform.css">
  </head>
  ```
  
  <h6> Once you have added the stylesheet to your document, simply add the correct class to the element that you
  wish to transform</h6>
  
 ```html
    <h2 class="transform-flyOut"> This heading will fly off the page </h2>
  ```
  
  [View the project page to see what each animation looks like](https://akshar13.github.io/transform.css)
  
  This may be used free of charge on any platform. Although I do not require it, I ask that you please give credit/mention to me. Happy transforms!
